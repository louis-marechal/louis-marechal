- 👋 Hi, I’m Louis Marechal
- 📊 With 7 years of professional experience in the media as a journalist, I started to work with Data during my time as a digital editor-in-chief in 2020. My method (collecting tailored Data from various sources, identifying KPIs, organizing, cleaning and modeling them, and creating reporting tools / dashboards) resulted in : a massive growth of YouTube subscribers for my employer, doubling of CPM, boost in ROAS and conversion rate.
<br />In 2024 I completed a Data Analyst diploma from École des Mines Paris - PSL, and am currently looking for new opportunities as a Data Analyst.
